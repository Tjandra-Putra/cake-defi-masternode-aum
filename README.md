# Masternode assets under management

The project was challenging yet rewarding, and I learned a lot while working on it.

Using the API, I was able to present the USD value of all active Dash and DeFiChain assets, as well as the total AUM as a single number. Additionally, I was able to include the logos for Dash and DeFiChain, and users can choose other currencies to display the assets under management.

I also went the extra mile and added a graphical representation of the AUM comparison between Dash and DeFiChain using a pie chart.
